## Description

> Take a break and catch up with your friend over a game of tic tac toe. It is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.

> Make a wrong move? Fear not as you can go back in time by reverting to your previous moves. That is if your friend agree to let you do so too ;)

### Challenges

1. Putting in place the logic for when a winner is decided after a user has click on the squares. I tackled this by assigning a 2d array of 'winlines' and see if the user moves lie in them.

### Improvements

1. Build a dynamic tic tac toe which allows for more than a 3x3 grid.
2. Have a scoring system set up to see which player wins more round.

### Technologies

1. CSS
2. React
   - React Transition Group (CSSTransition)

> I have used the above technologies to create an animated transitions of some components.
